# Movement pattern analysis using accelerometer sensor data
This challenge is based on the dataset which can be found here https://github.com/wchill/HMP_Dataset

Tasks:

* Create a R-Notebook on datascience.ibm.com
* Download the data to your remote staging area (Hint: "! git clone https://github.com/wchill/HMP_Dataset")
* Use the two provided R-Scripts and incorporate them into the notebook
* Review/Modify/Rerun them and make sure you understand how creation of additional features (mean, standard deviation) improves clustering performance
* Improve Clustering and/or Classification performance by engineering additional features like
  * DFT/FFT (Fourier Transformation)
  * Wavelets
  * your call
